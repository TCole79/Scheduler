# Interview Scheduler

This is a React-based project completed during weeks 7+8 of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development and Coding bootcamp.

As an introduction to React, the project creates an Interview Appointment Scheduler app with the following functionality:
- Allows a view by each day of the week to view booked interviews, and how many interview slots are open
- Allows booking, editing, and cancelling of interviews
- Error messages are shown if certain booking, editing, and/or deleting steps are not completed correctly
- Available and booked spots update correctly via React state without page refreshes

As part of the learning process, I utilized the following tools and processes:
- React
- Axios
- Webpack, Babel
- PostgreSQL

Testing via:
- Storybook
- Jest
- Cypress
- Webpack Dev Server
- Testing Library
